Very Quick Guide to Publishing HPSS Data with Base-Jumper

Note that this guide is a work in progress, please contact the author Sasha Ames sasha@llnl.gov (or look him up on the ESGF Slack channel) if you run into any issues.

(1) FIXME - run scripts to generate mapfile 

Once you have a mapfile in hand (see sample.map) you can do offline publishing

(2) edit /esg/config/esgcet/esg.ini - by default this is root user write, so you may want to change permission.

 -> best practice to publish as a regular unix user not root

(3) source your environment (ESGF v2.5.x or later)  

    $ source /usr/local/conda/bin/activate esgf-pub

(4) attepmt one-step publishing - the key is that you use --offline and --service hpss arguments unlike standard publishing
	The following assumes the above test mapfile, you'll need to change the specifics for your publication

	$ esgpublish --project test --map sample.map --offline --thredds --service hpss --publish

	You should be prompted to enter your esgf user/pass.  On test installations you can use the rootAdmin account with the password chosen when setting up the node.

    If there are errors, you may need to break up publishing into separate steps to see what went wrong.  

(5) Check your CoG site that the urls have been correctly published (search for project:TEST, "show files" in results)
